Key Projects & Accomplishments: System Optimization & Backend Refactoring - Conducted a full-system analysis to identify and resolve bugs across the stack (Node.js, Express.js, Angular). Analyzed and refactored the Node.js backend to enhance efficiency, reduce latency, and improve scalability. This included optimizing database calls and removing redundant API functions to lower operator action latency. Redesigned and implemented a new, efficient, and secure API to support a completely new user-facing mobile application. Feature Development & Integrations - Payment Gateways: Engineered integrations with a multitude of payment gateways, including API-hosted, SOAP (with StrongSwan VPN), and REST-based systems, as well as local bank and specialized processors like Cybersource. Managed infrastructure on Linux servers for a company-owned payment aggregator. Value-Added Services: Developed and deployed new platform features, including customer behavior tracking (store/item views), an 'Easy Checkout' API, sports game predictions for prizes, and booking systems for events and trips. Also built an in-app advertising feature. Third-Party Services: Integrated essential services including SMS, email, and push notifications. Data Warehouse & Business Intelligence - Data Pipeline: Architected and built a data warehouse by migrating data from MongoDB to a star-schema-designed PostgreSQL database using Airbyte. Analytics Dashboard: Built a comprehensive analytics dashboard in Odoo by integrating live and historical data via a secure API. The dashboard provided critical insights into Order Volume & Status (Completed, canceled, late orders), Operational Efficiency (Dispatch, prep, and delivery times), Customer Behavior (Acquisition, retention, order frequency), Financial Health (Revenue, expenses, net profit, payment methods). Analytics Datasets: Created specialized datasets in Python and Spark for deeper analysis, such as User-Store-Location and User-Item-Location correlations. Machine Learning Model Development - Developed and deployed several machine learning models to enhance platform features: ETA Prediction: Logistic Regression model using price, distance, and time variables. Route Optimization: Employed Google OR-Tools to optimize multi-stop delivery routes (Driver -> Store -> User). Recommendation Engines: Built user-based and item-based prediction models using K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. Geospatial Analysis: Used K-Means clustering to analyze destination hotspots and store-specific delivery zones. Forecasting: Developed daily order forecasting models.",

Key Projects & Accomplishments: ERP Implementation & Customization - Successfully deployed Odoo ERP for numerous clients, tailoring the system to meet specific industry needs and Ethiopian government compliance requirements. Developed custom modules from the ground up, demonstrating a profound understanding of Odoo's core modules (Accounting, Sales, Purchase), their interdependent workflows, and complex underlying calculations. Platform Migration & SaaS Development - Zmall Migration: Led the strategic migration of the Zmall delivery system from a MEAN stack to a fully integrated Odoo environment, including its complex payment gateway infrastructure. Zoorya (SaaS Project): Architected and built 'Zoorya', a managed SaaS ERP solution based on Odoo. This platform provides small and medium enterprises with a ready-made, compliant, and managed ERP system, complete with POS and payment integrations, eliminating the need for dedicated hardware and IT management. Scalability Experiments: Built a scalable stadium and referee booking application on Odoo with a Flutter frontend to test the platform's limits and capabilities. Integration & Data Management - Payment & POS Integration: Integrated a wide array of payment gateways and three distinct types of POS systems into Odoo, enabling seamless transactions and data synchronization. This included leading the direct hardware integration project.
